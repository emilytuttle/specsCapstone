This will be an app to help keep track of maintenance done to vehicles. Knowing when things were serviced or replaced is harder to keep track of if thereâ€™s more than one vehicle and having it all in one place and not on receipts or window stickers can be helpful.

Features:

-Register for an account
-Login/out
-Enter vehicles into page
-Add completed maintenance items to specific vehicles
-Edit vehicle or maintenance item info
-Delete maintenance items and vehicles
